Yuup is a restaurant listings site that assists users in finding a dining experience that best fits their needs. From price and photos, to location and average user experience, Yuup stylishly lists out everything is looking for. Upon logging in, the splash page search bar is auto filled with the users home location to assist in the searching process. Should one be looking for a hot spot that they may have not heard of before, a user can also go to one of the multiple randomly generated restaurants around the users location. Should that not be enough, simply clicking on the "find more" link on the bottom or entering their parameters in the search bar brings them to a page with more restaurants and their locations.

Now that anything anyone could ever want is within reach, the only decision left is to pick one! When a user has decided upon a restaurant, clicking any part of the restaurants name or title will bring them to the independent spaces show page, which will give a more detailed description of the space.
